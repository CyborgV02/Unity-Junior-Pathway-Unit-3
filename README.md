# 🕹️ Endless Runner – Unity Junior Programmer Pathway (Mission 3)

This project was created as part of the **Unity Junior Programmer Pathway (Mission 3)**.  
It’s a simple yet fun **Endless Runner** game built in **Unity 6**, where the player runs in place while the environment scrolls endlessly to create a smooth motion effect.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The player continuously runs forward and must **jump over obstacles** to survive as long as possible.  
Colliding with an obstacle triggers a **death animation** and **sound effect**, ending the run.
